  *mapsbr* is a Python package to help you get brazilian geospatial
data from official sources like IBGE or ArcGIS API.

  First it downloads a GeoJSON from the web with [[https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/][requests]], which gets
parsed by [[https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#predicates-and-relationships][shapely]] and passed into a [[http://geopandas.org/][geopandas]] structure, a =GeoSeries=
or a =GeoDataFrame=, which is your typical =pandas.DataFrame= but with
magic properties and methods regarding =shapely= geometric objects on
top of it.

  It's then, for example, trivial to plot a map or to make a
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map][choropleth map]] with =geopandas=. It does it very well with the help of
[[https://pypi.org/project/descartes/][descartes]] and [[https://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]]. But you can do many other things like
calculate area, get the interesection of two geometries etc.

  This package is inspired by the R package [[https://github.com/ipeaGIT/geobr][geobr]].

** Main Features
   
- Get and plot maps from IBGE.
- Get and plot maps from an ArcGIS source.

** Documentation

See our documentation at [[https://mapsbr.readthedocs.io/][readthedocs]].

** Example Usage

   As a simple example, let me demonstrate how one would plot the
brazilian map including many sub geographical levels:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session :exports both :results file

from mapsbr import ibgemaps
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=3, figsize=(10, 8), clear=True)
geographic_levels = ["macroregions", "states", "mesoregions", "microregions", "municipalities"]

for level, ax in zip(geographic_levels, axes.flat):
    ax.axis("off")
    ax.set_title("Brazil map with\n{}".format(level))
    ibgemaps.get_map("BR", including=level).plot(color="white", edgecolor="#2c3e50", ax=ax)

for ax in axes.flat:
    if not ax.has_data():
        fig.delaxes(ax)

fig.tight_layout()
fig.savefig("figs/brazilian_maps.png")
"figs/brazilian_maps.png"

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:figs/brazilian_maps.png]]
